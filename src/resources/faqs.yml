      version: "2"

      services:
       ....
        php:
             build: ./php/
            mem_limit: 4096m

      If you are seeing an error similar to "...error pulling image configuration: i/o timeout...", it is possible
      you have a stale network. You can resolve this issue by removing the network.

      List networks:    docker network ls
      Remove network:   docker network rm [the name of the network]
