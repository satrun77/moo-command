      Edit your docker-compose YML file and export mysql port.

      .... your docker-compose.yml or docker-compose-dev.yml ...
      mysql:
          ports:
            - "[replace with valid port]:3306"
      build: ./db/
      .....

      Use Standard connection in Sequel Pro:
      MySQL host:    the ip address of your computer or localhost
      Username:      database username from db.env
      Password:      database password from db.env
      Database:      database name from db.env
      Port:          The port number you have chosen to place in [replace with valid port]

      Within the container section you can add the following:
      mem_limit: [number of bytes]

      Example,
      ----------------------

      version: "2"

      services:
       ....
        php:
             build: ./php/
            mem_limit: 4096m
            expose:
                - 9000

      If you are seeing an error similar to "...error pulling image configuration: i/o timeout...", it is possible
      you have a stale network. You can resolve this issue by removing the network.

      List networks:    docker network ls
      Remove network:   docker network rm [the name of the network]
